# Release 1.4.5

Generation of skeleton Clojure webapp is now largely complete; this release is not the final 'beta' release of this functionality, but is a dummy run towards that release.

# Release 1.4.1

Release 1.4.1 adds a 'magnitude' element to entities, in order to provide a pragma for when
to switch to asynchronous select widgets.

It also provides a family of transforms, written in Clojure, to generate a skeleton Clojure
web app from an ADL specification.

# Release 1.4

Release 1.4 adds an 'order' element as a possible child of the 'list' element, in order to specify
the default order of lists. Otherwise unchanged from 1.3.
